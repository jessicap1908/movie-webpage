   <p> The day before Christmas,
On a gloomy day, Naila and Cecilia were practicing their dance for their upcoming Christmas performance. The sisters had been working hard on their dance that they decided to give themselves a break. 
During their break, Naila decides to order some food. The delivery man came twenty minutes after with her food. The man looked at Nailia in a weird and creepy way. This gives Naila goosebumps. Cecilia began to look fo her sister.
