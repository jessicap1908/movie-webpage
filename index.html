    <div class="Story">
   <p> The day before Christmas,
On a gloomy day, Naila and Cecilia were practicing their dance for their upcoming Christmas performance. The sisters had been working hard on their dance that they decided to give themselves a break. 
During their break, Naila decides to order some food. Naila asks Cecilia if she can head to the basement and grab a pack of napkins from the shelter. Cecilia heads down to the basement and grabs the pack of napkins. As she is about to leave, a glass cup drops on the floor. Cecilia does not get concerned since she believed that she probably dropped it by accident. She continues to head up the stairs when suddenly two other glass cups shatter into peices. Cecilia stops her way upstairs and heads to where the cups had shattered into pieces. She kneels to take a closer look. As she kneels down, the bathroom door opens. Cecilia begins to feel fear and starts running towards the exit but does not not make it out. A loud scream is heard coming from the basenment. Naila immediately knows who's it from; "Cecilia!".
